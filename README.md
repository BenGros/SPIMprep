A Snakemake workflow forp re-processing single plane illumination microscopy (SPIM, aka lightsheet microscopy)

## Requirements

 - Linux system with Singularity/Apptainer installed.
 - Python >= 3.11
 - Lightsheet data in a folder, or in a tar file (see tif filename pattern in `config.yml`)

## Usage


Clone this repository to the folder you want to run the workflow in, update the `config/datasets.tsv` to point to your dataset(s), and optionally update the `config/config.yml` with customized options. 

Install dependencies with:
```
pip install .
```

Then, to do a dry-run use:
```
snakemake -np 
```

To run on all cores use:
```
snakemake -c all --sdm apptainer
```

### WIP:  The usage of this workflow is described in the [Snakemake Workflow Catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/?usage=khanlab%2Fspimprep).


Note: Designed to work with data from the Miltenyi Biotec UltraMicroscope Blaze, but could be adapted to other types of data

## TODO:

 - [ ] any changes to post to Snakemake Workflow Catalog, and verify usage there
